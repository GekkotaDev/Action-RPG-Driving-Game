# `garage_subsystem`

Subsystem concerned with how vehicles are stored and accessed.

The garage subsystem hides the implementation details from dependents (such as
players and AI drivers) allowing the internal representations to change as much
as needed whilst minimizing disruption for the parent subsystems.
