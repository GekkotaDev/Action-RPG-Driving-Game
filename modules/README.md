# Modules

This directory can be thought of as an implementation of the [vertical slice architecture](https://www.milanjovanovic.tech/blog/vertical-slice-architecture)/feature driven development.

In contrast to [`assets`](../assets/) that focus less on implementation details and more on individual assets, the `modules` directory focuses on the implementation of features of the game. As an analogy, while `assets` may contain cars the `modules` directory contains the various systems that make those cars work.

It is advisable to have some familiarity with with the following

- Vertical Slice Architecture
- Single responsibility principle
- [Design patterns](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns)

But never to treat them as dogma (a principle or set of principles laid down by an authority as incontrovertibly true.).
