This vehicle chassis has been a resounding **failure**. With `VehicleWheel3D` nodes not playing nicely with the `Terrain` node from [Terrabrush](https://github.com/spimort/TerraBrush), it has been decided that development on a bespoke vehicle platform will be shelved until further notice.

We will continue to use an off-the-shelf [raycast based vehicle system](https://github.com/DAShoe1/Godot-Easy-Vehicle-Physics) that has been tested to work well with the terrain system in place. While unfortunate we were unable to use native features of the engine we should acknowledge our limited time budget for this project.
