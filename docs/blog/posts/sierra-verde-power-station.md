# ~~Battersea~~ Sierra Verde Power Station

<p style="text-align: center;">
  <i>How should we implement these power-ups?</i>

We could take further inspiration from the dialog system where the data in regards to this feature is managed by a central database functioning as some sort of repository, something that is being considered for other aspects of the game making use of Resources and Godot's binary serialization API to minimize dependencies.
