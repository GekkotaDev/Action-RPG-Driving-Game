# Auto Modellista

Ah, modelling the cars. Graphically, this is the crux of the game as you wouldn't wanna be spotted using off the shelf 3D models for what are arguably the most important visual part of the game given that they'll be seeing this all the time. Who would wanna play a game that's just a blatant asset dump/flip?

Originally the plan was to use Blender but it would've been far too much of an overwhelming experience to me with such a... not necessarily cluttered nor messy user interface but rather with how there was too much information on the screen it became about as comprehensible as that of an aircraft's dashboard; particularly important to learn for effective operation of something so capable yet would be a daunting task especially to someone who has to manage almost if not everything. ~~at least it's not Gimp~~

So what's the plan now? One would normally think Blender would be the only free option remaining with the rest being paid software. Fortunately, there's already free to use, free/libre and open source tools that serve as smaller in scope alternatives to some of Blender's functionality; that's where the tools Blockbench and Material Maker come in, and soon even PixiEditor can be included

To give some context to these tools Blockbench focuses on the modelling and painting aspect of Blender while Material Maker focuses more on the texturing side (and even has the same node based editor). PixiEditor on the other hand is one that I've just recently rediscovered and seems to be the perfect toolkit for 2D graphics aside from my original need in finding a pixel art program for programmers.

So far the work done with Blockbench can be observed in the one new vehicle that has been modelled from scratch while Material Maker's output had already been present with the grass seen in the game (though admittedly a revamp of the texture would've been nice).
