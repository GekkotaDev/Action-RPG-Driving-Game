Graphically, this is the crux of the game as you wouldn't wanna be spotted using off the shelf 3D models for what are arguably the most important visual part of the game given that they'll be seeing this all the time. Who would wanna play a game that's just a blatant asset dump/flip?</p> <p>Originally the plan was to use Blender but it would've been far too much of an overwhelming experience to me with such a... not necessarily cluttered nor messy user interface but rather with how there was too much information on the screen it became about as comprehensible as that of an aircraft's dashboard; particularly important to learn for effective operation of something so capable yet would be a daunting task especially to someone who has to manage almost if not everything. at least it's not Gimp</p> <p>So what's the plan now? One would normally think Blender would be the only free option remaining with the rest being paid software. Fortunately, there's already free to use, free/libre and open source tools that serve as smaller in scope alternatives to some of Blender's functionality; that's where the tools Blockbench and Material Maker come in, and soon even PixiEditor can be included</p> <p> </p> <p>To give some context to these tools Blockbench focuses on the modelling and painting aspect of Blender while Material Maker focuses more on the texturing side (and even has the same node based editor). PixiEditor on the other hand is one that I've just recently rediscovered and seems to be the perfect toolkit for 2D graphics aside from my original need in finding a pixel art program for programmers.</p> <p>So far the work done with Blockbench can be observed in the one new vehicle that has been modelled from scratch while Material Maker's output had already been present with the grass seen in the game (though admittedly a revamp of the texture would've been nice). A disappointing conclusion but having learnt these skills can be said to be a longer term investment in the game and in my own employment prospects.</p> <p></p>"},{"location":"blog/2025/11/07/contextual-dialog/","title":"(Another) Contextual Dialog Implementation","text":"<p> As if we didn't have enough of these already </p> <p>The dialog system itself is delegated to a third party library called Dialogue Manager although there are some bits that it's flexibility doesn't quite provide. How one would handle dialog context and responding to dialog contents.</p> <p>@aarthificial's video titled Dynamic Conversations has the answer that I would be looking for and had been cited within one of the group's documents, in particular the idea that the context is stored as a separate data structure independent of the game. This has the benefit where in-game dialog is not as tightly coupled to the game state, instead querying the dialog context through some form of proxy (or in other words, an implementation of the facade pattern).</p> <p>Here the data structure that represents this proxy are internally called stories which contain a collection of facts which themselves describe data that the dialog depends on. The dialog spoken by the characters will depend on the values of the facts within the stories provided to the dialog. This would entirely be moot however if the dialog can't be rendered in game.</p> <pre><code>---\ntitle: Figure 1. Dialog stories\n---\nclassDiagram\n    class DialogStory {\n        +String id\n        +Dictionary[String, Variant] facts\n    }</code></pre> <p>To get the dialog rendered in the first place there exists the method <code>.get_next_dialogue_line</code> which returns an empty dictionary when the dialog has been finished but that by itself wouldn't be enough.

This are effects that are ran in response to tags defined within the dialog itself, and is intended to be a more declarative alternative to mutations by shifting responsibility to the dialog caller.</p> <p>This should in theory be what's needed to implement the dialog system. This post will be updated with additional information as the subsystem is being designed.</p>"},{"location":"blog/2025/10/08/test-post-this-weeks-progress/","title":"Test Post (This Week's Progress)","text":"<p>For the progress that has been made so far this week it has been mainly setting up the architecture of the project, the infrastructure surrounding the project, and a few features that could be easily implemented.</p> <p>The infrastructure surrounding the project so far is a work in progress where this documentation site + developer logs have at least been implemented, but what has yet to be implemented would be (as of time of writing) actually publishing this site to be viewable without cloning the repository and automated workflow actions to reduce the amount of manual work needed to be done \u2014 that is, to automate the process of unit testing, publishing updates to this site, and the creation of binaries/executables.</p> <p>The architecture this project follows has been taking up shape with separation between assets and code* with the latter following the vertical slice architecture to keep the codebase easier to maintain by colocating the subsystems' files not by the work that they perform but rather the feature that they encompass.</p> <p>Feature wise we wanted to get over with the foundations for giving the player a frantic sense of speed achieved through a middleware system \u2014 an implementation of the chain of command pattern \u2014 where each chain focuses on a single responsibility given the context of the vehicle, camera and the delta time. Using this middleware system, we've implemented following tricks</p> <ul> <li>Blurring the player's depth of field vision based on their current speed to simulate the effect of tunnel vision. A phenomenon primarily associated with fighter aircraft but can happen in certain automobiles</li> <li>Stretching the player's field of vision based on their current speed. This effect is most noticeable in games such as Need For Speed ProStreet where it is used to great effect to make the cars feel faster than they actually are.</li> <li>Tire smoke, tire squealing and camera shake whenever the car loses traction (e.g: general wheel spin, lack of launch control). While not necessarily directly related to providing a sense of high speed can nevertheless imply that a car has enough engine power to overpower its own tires.</li> </ul> <p>Despite having these features implemented I'm not quite content with what to show so far</p> <ul> <li>Lack of vignette. While blurring the depth of field can help imply tunnel vision, it does feel like it's missing something to fully sell the effect which is where gradually introducing a vignette effect can help.</li> <li>Lack of damage particle effects. This is not merely for appearance purposes but rather to sell the impression to the player where there's consequences to driving dirty even if it's merely loss of time from losing momentum.</li> <li>Lack of vehicles. Fortunately it's quite easy to implement the actual behaviors of the vehicles given it's just node composition whilst modelling shouldn't be too difficult given low polygon count and the invaluable resources on how to use Blender (most important are mesh extrusions. protusions, and the likes, boolean operations and other modifiers, and some slight raw vertex manipulation).</li> <li>Camera vibrations relative not to the player's speed but to their velocity taking into account that not only can camera vibrations be used to simulate mechanical vibrations at high speed but also effects such as crashes.</li> </ul> <p>As of this time of writing, I plan on setting up automated workflows (CI/CD) and kanban based progress tracking (Github Projects), perhaps setting up templates for Github Issues to formalize bug reporting \u2014 in other words structured and unvague reports \u2014 and to set up Github Discussions to address a rather self-destructive flaw of Facebook Messenger where information is easily lost with the total lack of organized discussions. It is ideal information does not get lost (assuming everyone is on-board with this workflow otherwise we'll just have to continue with a data lossy workflow).</p>"},{"location":"blog/2025/10/08/test-post-this-weeks-progress/#update-2025-11-07","title":"UPDATE (2025-11-07)","text":"<ul> <li>Instead of using Blender I've opted to using a combination of Blockbench and Material Maker (for textures; think albedos, normal maps, bump maps, etc.)</li> <li>I still haven't set up the kanban board quite properly yet.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"blog/archive/2025/","title":"2025","text":""},{"location":"blog/category/design/","title":"Design","text":""},{"location":"blog/category/modelling/","title":"Modelling","text":""},{"location":"blog/category/programming/","title":"Programming","text":""},{"location":"blog/category/general/","title":"General","text":""}]}
